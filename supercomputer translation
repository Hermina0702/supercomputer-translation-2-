The saying of philosopher René Descartes of what makes humans unique is beginning to sound hollow. 'I think -- therefore soon I am obsolete' seems more appropriate. When a computer routinely beats us at chess and we can barely navigate without the help of a GPS, have we outlived our place in the world? Not quite. Welcome to the front line of research in cognitive skills, quantum computers and gaming.
> 哲学家勒内·笛卡尔说的人类独特的部分被撼动了. '我思考, 所以我会被淘汰'也许更合适. 
> 当电脑习以为常地打败我们, 或者不用 GPS 就无法到达正确位置时, 人类在这个世界是否已失去作用?
> 并不是. 欢迎来到认知技能的研究前沿, 量子计算机以及量子游戏.

Today there is an on-going battle between man and machine. While genuine machine consciousness is still years into the future, we are beginning to see computers make choices that previously demanded a human's input. Recently, the world held its breath as Google's algorithm AlphaGo beat a professional player in the game Go--an achievement demonstrating the explosive speed of development in machine capabilities.
> 今日人与机器之间已经开战. 真正的机器意识虽仍未到来, 我们已经可以看到计算机做出选择, 而这些以前是需要人类输入的. 
> 前段时间, 全世界瞩目的 Google 的 AlphaGo 打败了围棋的职业选手, 这件事彰显出机器能力的爆炸性发展.

But we are not beaten yet -- human skills are still superior in some areas. This is one of the conclusions of a recent study by Danish physicist Jacob Sherson, published in the journal Nature.
> 但我们还未能言败 -- 人类技能仍在许多领域占优势. 
> 丹麦物理学家 Jacob Sherson 最近在自然(Nature)杂志上发表了以上述为结论的研究.

"It may sound dramatic, but we are currently in a race with technology -- and steadily being overtaken in many areas. Features that used to be uniquely human are fully captured by contemporary algorithms. Our results are here to demonstrate that there is still a difference between the abilities of a man and a machine," explains Jacob Sherson.
> "听上去很戏剧性, 但我们的确在于科技竞争中, 并逐步在许多领域被赶超.
> 曾经专属于人类的特征被算法完全夺取了. 
> 我们的研究结果表明人和机器的能力仍然有差别." Jacob Sherson 解释道.

At the interface between quantum physics and computer games, Sherson and his research group at Aarhus University have identified one of the abilities that still makes us unique compared to a computer's enormous processing power: our skill in approaching problems heuristically and solving them intuitively. The discovery was made at the AU Ideas Centre CODER, where an interdisciplinary team of researchers work to transfer some human traits to the way computer algorithms work. ?
> 在量子物理以及电脑游戏的连接点上, Sherson 和他的研究小组在奥胡斯大学发现了一项能力仍然专属于人类, 即使和电脑庞大的处理能力相比, 那就是人类启发式的处理问题或者直觉地解决问题的技能. 
> 这个结果是在 AU Ideas Centre CODER 被发现的. 
> 在这里, 跨学科的研究者将一些人类性格特征转化为电脑算法工作的方式.

Quantum physics holds the promise of immense technological advances in areas ranging from computing to high-precision measurements. However, the problems that need to be solved to get there are so complex that even the most powerful supercomputers struggle with them. This is where the core idea behind CODER--combining the processing power of computers with human ingenuity -- becomes clear. ?
> 量子物理背负着艰巨的科技发展重担, 从计算到高精度测量. 
> 但是, 需要解决的问题太过复杂以致于最厉害的超级计算机也无法很好发挥作用.
> 所以 CODER 的核心理念"将人类的创造力与电脑的处理能力相结合"也非常清晰了.

## Our common intuition
> ## 直觉

Like Columbus in QuantumLand, the CODER research group mapped out how the human brain is able to make decisions based on intuition and accumulated experience. This is done using the online game "Quantum Moves." Over 10,000 people have played the game that allows everyone contribute to basic research in quantum physics.
> 就像哥伦布在量子大陆, CODER 研究小组描绘出大脑是如何以直觉和经验为基础来做决定的. 
> 这是由在线游戏"量子移动"完成的.
> 超过一万人玩过这个游戏, 所以所有人都对量子物理的基础研究做了贡献.

"The map we created gives us insight into the strategies formed by the human brain. We behave intuitively when we need to solve an unknown problem, whereas for a computer this is incomprehensible. A computer churns through enormous amounts of information, but we can choose not to do this by basing our decision on experience or intuition. It is these intuitive insights that we discovered by analysing the Quantum Moves player solutions," explains Jacob Sherson. ?
> "我们创造的这幅图启发我们发现大脑是如何形成策略的.
> 当我们面对未知问题时, 我们借住直觉去解决, 然而这种情况在电脑看来是不可思议的.
> 电脑需要处理大量信息, 但人类可以只凭借经验或直觉.
> 那些直觉上的见解就是我们在分析量子移动玩家时发现的." Jacob Sherson 解释道.

> This is how the "Mind Atlas" looks. Based on 500.000 completed games the group has been able to visualize our ability to solve problems. Each peak on the 'map' represents a good idea, and the area with the most peaks - marked by red rings - are where the human intuition has hit a solution. A computer can then learn to focus on these areas, and in that way 'learn' about the cognitive functions of a human. (Ill: CODER/AU)
>> 这就是 Mind Atlas 的样子. 利用50万完成的游戏, 研究小组对我们解决问题的能力进行了可视化.
>> 这幅图上的每个小山峰代表了一个好的想法, 有最多山峰的区域, 也就是标记为红色环的部分就是直觉成功找到解决方法的地方.
>> 电脑可以学习专注于此块区域, 以此种方式学习人类的认知功能.

The laws of quantum physics dictate an upper speed limit for data manipulation, which in turn sets the ultimate limit to the processing power of quantum computers -- the Quantum Speed ??Limit. Until now a computer algorithm has been used to identify this limit. It turns out that with human input researchers can find much better solutions than the algorithm.
> 量子物理的原理要求处理数据的一个速度上限, 这又反过来影响到量子计算机处理能力的最终限制, 量子速度限制.
> 时至今日, 仍然有电脑算法被用来找寻这个限制.
> 实际发现有了人类输入后, 比起算法, 研究人员能找到更好的解决方法.

"The players solve a very complex problem by creating simple strategies. Where a computer goes through all available options, players automatically search for a solution that intuitively feels right. Through our analysis we found that there are common features in the players' solutions, providing a glimpse into the shared intuition of humanity. If we can teach computers to recognise these good solutions, calculations will be much faster. In a sense we are downloading our common intuition to the computer" says Jacob Sherson.
> "玩家通过制定简单的策略解决了非常复杂的问题.
> 当电脑枚举所有可能的选择, 玩家自然而然以直觉寻找认为是正确的方法.
> 在分析中, 我们发现玩家的解答有相同的特征, 这也许是人类共享直觉的小证据.
> 如果我们可以教会电脑认知这些好方法, 计算就会变得更快了.
> 某种意义上来说, 我们在把人类的直觉下载到电脑上." Jacob Sherson 说道.

And it works. The group has shown that we can break the Quantum Speed Limit by combining the cerebral cortex and computer chips. This is the new powerful tool in the development of quantum computers and other quantum technologies.
> 然后成功了. 研究小组证明了结合大脑皮层和电脑芯片可以打破量子限速.
> 这在量子计算机以及其他量子科技的发展中会是一个崭新的, 强大的工具.

## We are the new supercomputer

Science is often perceived as something distant and exclusive, conducted behind closed doors. To enter you have to go through years of education, and preferably have a doctorate or two. Now a completely different reality is materialising.?

In recent years, a new phenomenon has appeared--citizen science breaks down the walls of the laboratory and invites in everyone who wants to contribute. The team at Aarhus University uses games to engage people in voluntary science research. Every week people around the world spend 3 billion hours playing games. Games are entering almost all areas of our daily life and have the potential to become an invaluable resource for science.

> Humans spend 3.000.000.000 hours gaming away on smartphones and other mobile devices. If it is possible to tap into that calculating resource by just one percent, we would be more than a match for the computer. (Photo: Colourbox)

"Who needs a supercomputer if we can access even a small fraction of this computing power? By turning science into games, anyone can do research in quantum physics. We have shown that games break down the barriers between quantum physicists and people of all backgrounds, providing phenomenal insights into state-of-the-art research. Our project combines the best of both worlds and helps challenge established paradigms in computational research," explains Jacob Sherson.

The difference between the machine and us, figuratively speaking, is that we intuitively reach for the needle in a haystack without knowing exactly where it is. We 'guess' based on experience and thereby skip a whole series of bad options. For Quantum Moves, intuitive human actions have been shown to be compatible with the best computer solutions. In the future it will be exciting to explore many other problems with the aid of human intuition.

"We are at the borderline of what we as humans can understand when faced with the problems of quantum physics. With the problem underlying Quantum Moves we give the computer every chance to beat us. Yet, over and over again we see that players are more efficient than machines at solving the problem. While Hollywood blockbusters on artificial intelligence are starting to seem increasingly realistic, our results demonstrate that the comparison between man and machine still sometimes favours us. We are very far from computers with human-type cognition," says Jacob Sherson and continues:

"Our work is first and foremost a big step towards the understanding of quantum physical challenges. We do not know if this can be transferred to other challenging problems, but it is definitely something that we will work hard to resolve in the coming years."
